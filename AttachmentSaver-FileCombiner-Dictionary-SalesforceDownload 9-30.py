##              To Do List
##              1. clean up the directories by making them dynamic
##              2. get the new file out of the attachment combiner function
##              3. get the file into the file mailer function
##              4. need to retrieve the opportunity ID from salesforce\
##              5. need to combine the opportunity id with our combined results lists before they are mailed to the OPS team

##The below code helps by downloading the attachments from outlook emails that are 'Unread' (and changes the mail to Read.) or from 'Today's' date.without altering the file name. Just pass the 'Subject' argument.
