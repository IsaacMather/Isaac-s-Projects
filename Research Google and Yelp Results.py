#TODO
#3. get the results from the Yelp into the practice info spreadsheet
#4. get the loop to only save the info to the file once, not each time a new practice is called. roughly line 194
#5. check what is going into the query api and main functions, need to clean up which files are being used where




##What's the challenge:
##	Ensuring the provider database is up to date and accurate
##	
##Can we use the Google search or yelo api, to search an address, and get back information about the location? 
##Do it by step by step, and ask for user input, and see if this is what they are looking for. 
##Keep the search result link, the yelp and the google result, for each line item, to act as a reference 
##
##Take a practice I know exists, use it as a test, have the program rip through the spreadsheet of addresses and return search results. 
##
##Create a flow chart, and reconnect with Justin.
##search google maps for the search result, and see if it is open or closed

#1. iterate through the sheets, combining name and address into a text field that we search for. Return the top 5 search results for this thing.

"""
Yelp Fusion API code sample.
This program demonstrates the capability of the Yelp Fusion API
by using the Search API to query for businesses by a search term and location,
and the Business API to query additional information about the top result
from the search query.
Please refer to http://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/documentation for the API
documentation.
This program requires the Python requests library, which you can install via:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Sample usage of the program:
`python sample.py --term="bars" --location="San Francisco, CA"`
