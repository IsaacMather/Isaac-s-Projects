##What's the challenge:
##	Ensuring the provider database is up to date and accurate
##	
##Can we use the Google search or yelo api, to search an address, and get back information about the location? 
##Do it by step by step, and ask for user input, and see if this is what they are looking for. 
##Keep the search result link, the yelp and the google result, for each line item, to act as a reference 
##
##Take a practice I know exists, use it as a test, have the program rip through the spreadsheet of addresses and return search results. 
##
##Create a flow chart, and reconnect with Justin.
##search google maps for the search result, and see if it is open or closed

#1. iterate through the sheets, combining name and address into a text field that we search for. Return the top 5 search results for this thing.
